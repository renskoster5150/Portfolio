            <p>For this assignment we had to make a layout for a single page, for multiple screen sizes. This had to align with the corporate identity of Rotterdam and had to include an animation as well. The hardest part about this assignment was combining the minimalistic style of Rotterdam, with a 'funky' jazz style</p>
            <p>Take a better look at the design (Click on title to change screen width) <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/esjGePyMoEABk9AFmKuben/PUBLIC-CITY-JAZZ?node-id=0-1&t=pkFW4BCTQwG4RqmL-1">Here!</a></p>
            <h2>The animation</h2>
            <p>As I said, we also had to make an animation. This animation was based on a song that could be played at the event. You can see the animation I made here:</p>
